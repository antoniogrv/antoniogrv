### Hello!

I'm Antonio, and I'm currently employed as a Core Site Reliability Engineer II at [Prima](https://www.helloprima.com/). Previously, I worked as a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer at [Leonardo](https://www.leonardo.com/en/).

Mainly, I work with Kubernetes & all-things cloud-native, especially on AWS. Deeply engaged in in networking, observability and cybersecurity. Not much of a SWE, but very interested in Rust.

Feel free to reach out if you want to connect!
